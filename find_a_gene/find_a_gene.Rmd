## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Generate a heatmap of a multiple alignment of multiple species with proteins similar in identity to human IGFBP-6

#Initiate the Bio3D package

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

#Read the fasta file for the alignment

```{r}
fasta <- read.fasta("A20200312A94466D2655679D1FD8953E075198DA801240AL.fasta.txt")
fasta
```

#Plot the alignment

```{r}
plot.fasta(fasta, mar4 = 5, )
```

#Generate a sequence identity matrix and plot via heatmap

```{r}
identity <- seqidentity(fasta)
heatmap(identity, margins = c(8,8))
```

```{r}

```
